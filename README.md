# Timetable

## Background
This project was forked from @zulihan's [ng-timetable](https://github.com/zulihan/ng-timetable) which is an adaptation of @Grible's [timetable.js](https://github.com/Grible/timetable.js) for use in Angular.

I wanted to evaluate how this library might work in a client project, so I have simply converted it to a component here for easier integration.

## Angular CLI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
